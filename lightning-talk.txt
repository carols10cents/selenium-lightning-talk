Driving Selenium With Ruby
(Bonus: yes, Windows Ruby devs DO exist!)

== Selenium is... ==
* a set of web browser automation tools
* Supports many browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera, Chrome)
* Has wrapper libraries for many languages (C#, Java, Ruby and more!)

== Why did we start using Selenium? ==
* We make web applications
* We have weird legacy code, no good way to test besides through the browser
* Motto: We don't do manual testing!
* In rails: JavaScript

== Why might you not want to use Selenium? ==
* Opening and using a browser is slow (x min vs y min with capybara+rack-test)
* Might be overkill
* Can be brittle
* Still can't do subjective testing like "page looks pretty"

== In Ruby ==
* selenium-rc + selenium-client
vs
* selenium-webdriver (aka selenium 2.0. different framework => different api)
(also selenium-ide and selenium-grid, out of scope)
plus
* Test harness of your choice (RSpec supports creating nice reports)

== Selenium RC is ==

== Selenium client is ==

== Setup ==
Skipping! What works for us will be up on my github.

== Use ==
.open
.click
:wait_for (ajax)
.type
.is_text_present
supported locators

== Demo == 
* Make video for backup

== Reports ==
* With screenshots!

== Things that are tricky ==
* Opening new windows
* JS dialogs
